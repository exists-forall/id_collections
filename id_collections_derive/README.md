# `id_collections_derive`

This crate implements procedural macros which are re-exported by the [`id_collections`](https://crates.io/crate/id_collections) crate. Due to limitations of Rust's procedural macro system, these procedural macros cannot be implemented as part of `id_collections` itself. You should not use this crate directly, and should instead use these macros via the `id_collections` crate.
